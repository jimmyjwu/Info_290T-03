PROBLEM 4: NORMALIZATION
I lost points for purely arithmetic mistakes. Min-max normalization in the range [0, 1] scales the data according to the formula
			 v - min 	v - 5
	v_new = --------- = -----
			max - min 	 20
The output is thus
	[0, 1, 1/20, 7/20, 1/2]


PROBLEM 7.4: PIVOT
A pivot operation swaps/rotates two axes or dimensions.
	Example: we have a mapping:
			ad --> pixel dimensions of ad.
	A pivot transforms this into the mapping:
			dimensions --> ads


PROBLEM 10: INFORMATION GAIN
When building a decision tree, the attribute with the highest information gain is used to split on the current node. Intuitively, the optimal choice of attribute minimizes the randomness/entropy/impurity in the resulting partition, in the hope that the output decision tree will be small (because few decisions will be needed to accurately classify a new data point).


PROBLEM 14: DENDROGRAM
I made the mistake of drawing the B-D merger and C-E merge at the same point in time.
Correct dendrogram:
	A 		D 		B 		C 		E
	|		|		|		|		|
	|		---------		|		|
	|			|			|		|
	|			|			---------
	|			|				|
	|			|				|
	-------------				|
			|					|
			|					|
			---------------------
