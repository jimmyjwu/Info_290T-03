Homework 2: Obtain and Explore Data

Data set:
	Facebook social data obtained from
		http://snap.stanford.edu/data/egonets-Facebook.html
	This data set contains partial information for a subset of Facebook's social graph.

Types of information available:
	- The social graph: a list of nodes (people) numbered 0 through 4038 and 88234 edges
	(friendships) between them.
	- "Circles": lists that people manually create, to categorize their friends.
	- "Features": "1" if a person lists a feature (e.g. "age") on his/her
	profile; "0" if not listed.

An interesting record:
	Under user 698:		"circle9	697"
	This means means that some person "user 698" has a friends list, to which he/she
	added only one person. Usually friend lists contain a broad category of people, so
	a particularly tight-knit list like this may suggest indicate a special relationship.

Three questions that can be answered with this data set:
	1. What cliques (both in the social sense and the graph-theoretic sense) exist in the
	social graph?
	2. Who are the influential players in the clusters found in the graph? Who are the
	"bridges" that connect different clusters?
	3. What properties make people more likely to be part of the same cluster?
